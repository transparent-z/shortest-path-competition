# Second-generation solver research

The rollback checkpoint is Git tag `baseline-official-7x` (commit `d347d0e`).
Dispatch in the new solver uses only graph flags, vertex/edge/query counts, and
measured endpoint multiplicities; it never uses paths, filenames, or seeds.

## Observed large workload statistics

| workload | Q | unique sources | unique targets | max source freq | max target freq | targets freq >=4 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| road2d | 200,000 | 200,000 | 135,113 | 1 | 126 | 3,190 |
| lattice3d | 30,000 | 30,000 | 28,478 | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| local2d | 300,000 | 300,000 | 188,635 | 1 | 7 | 6,073 |
| scalefree | 50,000 | 50,000 | 33,240 | 1 | 70 | 303 |
| hugeq | 600,000 | 50,176 | 50,176 | 12 | 29 | 50,067 |
| wide64 | 30,000 | 30,000 | 29,775 | 1 | 3 | 0 |

The graph scan confirmed directed road2d/hugeq/scalefree graphs and undirected
lattices; average out-degrees are approximately 5.4, 5.4, 2.9, 2, 3, and 2.
Lattice weights range from small integers on lattice3d/local2d to 1e8--1e9 on
wide64. Road graphs carry coordinates but variable-speed weights. Queries show
no source repetition except hugeq. Target repetition is strongest in hugeq and
in the scale-free hub mixture. The generator and sampled endpoint rank mixes
confirm local2d's predominantly short-range workload; the other query sets are
predominantly global.

## Candidates

| candidate | targeted result | decision |
|---|---|---|
| Directed/undirected ALT, 8 landmarks | weak on scale-free large (>125 s before completion) | reject there; grouped hot targets win |
| Directed ALT, 16 landmarks | road large varied from about 136 s to over 200 s, exact | reject; no reliable end-to-end improvement |
| Undirected ALT, 12 landmarks | local2d large about 100 s, exact | retain; major improvement over the prior roughly 278 s checkpoint |
| ALT, 24 landmarks, per-query A* | hugeq large exceeded 180 s | reject; endpoint grouping is better |
| ALT on sparse-query degree-6 / huge lattices | preprocessing cannot amortize | reject structurally; preserve lattice3d and wide64 paths |
| Existing grouped forward/reverse SSSP | hugeq and hot scale-free targets | retain |

ALT landmarks use farthest-point selection from an observable high-degree
starting vertex. Directed lower bounds combine `d(L,t)-d(L,v)` and
`d(v,L)-d(t,L)`; unreachable terms are ignored. Complete preprocessing time is
included in every timing above.
